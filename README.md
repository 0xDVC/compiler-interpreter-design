# COMPILER & INTERPRETER DESIGN
Based on a book - Ronald Mak _(Writing Compilers and Interpreters - A Software Engineering Approach)_.

This code base would contain all implementations and examples highlighted in the book as well as personal insights on topics covered. The goal of this is to understand compiler and interpreter design by designing my own rudimentary system.
